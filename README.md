This was a simple project that used Node.js, Express Server, EJS, HTML, CSS, and the Bulma CSS framework.
This was to showcase what I had recently learned, still have a ways to go, but I did enjoy getting to work on this.

The project it self allows the user to "leave a comment". Since there is no backend to this, it basically just posts it to the page.
I enjoyed getting to learn how the backend functions and getting to know how to scrape information from user entered data.
